                    a duck in the game. The duck was protected by other players and placed high on a rock. He also wanted the game to be safer and so the sport was played with soccer balls and peach baskets placed at about 10 feet high, involved less
                    physical contact, drew players attention on the ball and not on other players. He developed a set of thirteen rules and the first match was held on December 21st, 1891 among two teams of nine players each at Springfield College.</div>
